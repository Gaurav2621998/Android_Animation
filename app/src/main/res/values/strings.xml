    <string name="data">Animation is a method in which pictures are
        manipulated to appear as moving images.
        In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand
        on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film.
        Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).
        Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer
        animation can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster
        real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion
        technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets
        or clay figures.
        Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential
        images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures
        in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the
        exact causes are still uncertain.
